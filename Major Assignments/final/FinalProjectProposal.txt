CMPUT 275 FINAL PROJECT PROPOSAL

Project Title: Arduino Wired Text Message
Group Members: Weichen Qiu, Gurbani Baweja
_______

Description:
In this project, we are planning to implement a text message application between 2 arduinos.
The arduinos will be wired together either directed or via a C++ server.
Both arduinos will have a GUI on the touchscreen with a touch keyboard and the messages. We will 
have to implement a compact keyboard that is accurate and scrolling of the messages.
The messages will be stored on a linked list algorithm that will store the order of the messages.
To add more complexity, we plan on use a passive buzzer to sound when messages are received
and a tilt sensor to rotate the display between portrait and landscape mode. At the very end if there
is still time, we may encrypt the messages given that it does not increase runtime significantly.

Milestones:
1. March 20 - start on project
2. By March 25 - Finish touchscreen and user interface
3. B March 27 - Add tilt and speaker
4. By March 28 - Finish backend with communication between the two arduinos
5. April 2 - Demo date
6. April 10 - Code Completed

Bonus Milestones:
- Encryption
